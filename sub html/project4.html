                    <h3>Project 3D</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is my project to recreate the rendering of the clasic Wolfenstein3D. <br>
                        I created this live demo above with the P5.js library and the open source code of the Wolfenstein3D that is available on github.
                        I was very interested how to render 3D games without a 3D engine so i started to wonder how to make a simple 3D rendering.
                        In my research i found out about raytracing and how it could be used for graphics for games like Wolfenstein3D, 
                        So i decided to use raytracing to make a 3D(ish) render. <br> <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The picture to the left shows some of my code for the map / rendering for the minimap.
                        Its a class with a 2 dimentional array with values between 0 and 3, 0 meaning a open space where you can walk and 1 for a red wall 2 for green wall and 3 for blue wall.
                        The render option for the map just loops over every object in the 2d array and looks at their place in the array to place them on the screen with the size of the minimap multiplier.
                        <br> <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the snipped below my 3D wall is being.
                        First we loop over all the rays we send from the player afther we looped over all the rays we,
                        calulate the distance to the wall so we get the correct distance with the projection screen with that we calculate the height of the wall.
                        With the height of wall and the angle of the ray we can start to draw the wall part.
                        Then we take the color of the map 2D array and use that color for the wall.
